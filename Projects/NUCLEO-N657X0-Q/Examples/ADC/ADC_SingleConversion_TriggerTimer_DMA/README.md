## <b>ADC_SingleConversion_TriggerTimer_DMA Example Description</b>

How to use an ADC peripheral to perform a single ADC conversion on a channel 
at each trigger event from a timer. Converted data is transferred by DMA 
into a table in RAM memory.
This example is based on the STM32N6xx ADC HAL API.

Example configuration:

ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from HW trigger: timer peripheral (timer instance: TIM2).
timer is configured to provide a time base of 1kHz.
DMA is configured to transfer conversion data in an array, in circular mode.
A timer is configured in time base and to generate TRGO events.

Example execution:

From the main program execution, the ADC group regular converts the
selected channel at each trig from timer. DMA transfers conversion data to the array,
indefinitely (DMA in circular mode).

When conversion are completed (DMA half or full buffer complete),
interruption occurs and data is processed in callback functions (for this example purpose,
convert digital data to physical value in mV).

LED1 is used to monitor program execution status:

- Normal operation: ADC group regular buffer activity (buffer complete events):
  LED toggle at frequency of time base / half buffer size (approx. 31Hz with this example default settings)
- Error: LED remaining turned on

Debug: variables to monitor with debugger:

- "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular buffer conversion data (resolution 12 bits)
- "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC group regular buffer conversion data computed to voltage value (unit: mV)

Connection needed:

Use an external power supply to generate a voltage in range [0V; 1.8V]
and connect it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

**Note:** If no power supply available, this pin can be let floating (in this case
ADC conversion data will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:

 - 1 GPIO for LED1
 - 1 GPIO for analog input: ADC channel 1 on pin PA.01 (Morpho connector CN15 pin 38)
 - 1 DMA channel
 - 1 timer instance

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32N657X0HxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-N657X0-Q board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
    
  - **EWARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must proceed as follow :
    - Start a debugging session.
    - Open the View > Images.
    - Double-click to deselect the second instance of project.out.

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Set the boot mode in development mode (BOOT1 switch position is 2-3, BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter).
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory. Code can be executed in this mode for debugging purposes.

 Next, this program can be run in boot from flash mode. This is done by following the instructions below:

 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated binary Project.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin Project.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o Project-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump Project-trusted.bin*
   - The resulting binary is Project-trusted.bin.
 - Next, in resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the binary and its header (Project-trusted.bin) in the board external Flash at address 0x7000'0000.
 - Set the boot mode in boot from external Flash (BOOT0 switch position is 1-2 and BOOT1 switch position is 1-2).
 - Press the reset button. The code then executes in boot from external Flash mode.

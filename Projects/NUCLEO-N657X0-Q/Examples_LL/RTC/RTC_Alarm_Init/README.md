## <b>RTC_Alarm_Init Example Description</b>

Configuration of the RTC LL API to configure and generate an alarm using the RTC peripheral. The peripheral
initialization uses the LL initialization function.

The system clock runs at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the Configure_RTC() function
(configure of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware CLOCK,
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

**Note:** LSI oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source by default.

    The user can use also LSE as RTC clock source.
    - The user uncomment the adequate line on the main.c file.
      @code
        #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSI
        /* #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSE */
      @endcode
    LSI oscillator clock is delivered by a 32 kHz RC.
    LSE (when available on board) is delivered by a 32.768 kHz crystal.

Configure_RTC_Alarm function is then called to initialize the
time, date and alarm.

In this example, the Time is set to 11:59:55 PM and the Alarm must be generated after
30 seconds on 12:00:25 AM.

LED1 is turned ON when the RTC Alarm is generated correctly.

The current time and date are updated and displayed on the debugger in aShowTime
and aShowDate variables (watch or live watch).

In case of error, LED1 is toggling.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32N657X0HxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-N657X0-Q board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


  - **EWARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must proceed as follow :
    - Start a debugging session.
    - Open the View > Images.
    - Double-click to deselect the second instance of project.out. 

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Set the boot mode in development mode (BOOT1 switch position is 2-3, BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter).
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory. Code can be executed in this mode for debugging purposes.

 Next, this program can be run in boot from flash mode. This is done by following the instructions below:
 
 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated binary Project.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin Project.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o Project-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump Project-trusted.bin*
   - The resulting binary is Project-trusted.bin.
 - Next, in resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the binary and its header (Project-trusted.bin) in the board external Flash at address 0x7000'0000.
 - Set the boot mode in boot from external Flash (BOOT0 switch position is 1-2 and BOOT1 switch position is 1-2).
 - Press the reset button. The code then executes in boot from external Flash mode.

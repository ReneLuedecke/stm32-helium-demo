## <b>TIM_OutputCompare_Init Example Description</b>

Configuration of the TIM peripheral to generate an output 
waveform in different output compare modes. This example is based on the 
STM32N6xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

     In this example TIM1 input clock (TIM1CLK) is set to TIMPRE clock,
    since TIMPRE prescaler is equal to 1.
      TIMPRE = SYSB
      => TIM1CLK = HCLK = SystemBusClock (400 MHz)

To set the TIM1 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is
calculated as follows:

    PSC = (TIM1CLK / TIM1 counter clock) - 1
    PSC = ((SystemBusClock/1) /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 600 MHz for STM32N6xx Devices.

Auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a time base period of 100 ms,
meaning a time base frequency of 10 Hz.

    ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / time base frequency) - 1
    ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / 10) - 1

The capture/compare register (CCR1) of the output channel is set to half the
auto-reload value. Therefore the timer output compare delay is 50 ms.
Generally speaking this delay is calculated as follows:

    CC1_delay = TIM1 counter clock / CCR1

The timer output channel must be connected to PE9 on board NUCLEO-N657X0-Q.
Thus TIM1_CH1 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output level (active v.s. inactive).

USER push-button can be used to change the output compare mode:

  - When the output channel is configured in output compare toggle:  TIM1_CH1 
    TOGGLES when the counter (CNT) matches the capture/compare register (CCR1).
  - When the output channel is configured in output compare active:  TIM1_CH1 
    switched ON when the counter (CNT) matches the capture/compare register
    (CCR1).
  - When the output channel is configured in output compare inactive:  TIM1_CH1 
    switched OFF when the counter (CNT) matches the capture/compare register
    (CCR1).
    
Initially the output channel is configured in output compare toggle mode.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32N657X0HxQ devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-N657X0-Q board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  - NUCLEO-N657X0-Q Set-up:
      - TIM1_CH1  PE9: connected to pin 31 of CN15 connector 

  - **EWARM** : To monitor a variable in the live watch window, you must proceed as follow :
    - Start a debugging session.
    - Open the View > Images.
    - Double-click to deselect the second instance of project.out. 
 
### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Set the boot mode in development mode (BOOT1 switch position is 2-3, BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter).
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory. Code can be executed in this mode for debugging purposes.

Next, this program can be run in boot from flash mode. This is done by following the instructions below:

 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated binary Project.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin Project.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o Project-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump Project-trusted.bin*
   - The resulting binary is Project-trusted.bin.
 - Next, in resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the binary and its header (Project-trusted.bin) in NUCLEO-N657X0-Q board external Flash at address 0x7000'0000.
 - Set the boot mode in boot from external Flash (BOOT0 switch position is 1-2 and BOOT1 switch position is 1-2).
 - Press the reset button. The code then executes in boot from external Flash mode.
 - Run the example

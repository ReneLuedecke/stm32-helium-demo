## <b>ROT_Provisioning OEMuROT Description</b>

This section provides available configuration scripts for OEMuROT example.


To ease the configuration process, da\_programming, flash\_programming, keys\_generation, keys\_programming and provisioning scripts are used.
The da\_programming script compute the hash of the password located in \Config\DA\_password.bin and program it into OTP 292 - 299.
The flash\_programming script downloads the images.
The keys\_generation script generates new OEMuROT keys and store them in \Keys\ folder.
The keys\_programming script program OEMuROT keys into OTP 268 - 291.
The provisioning script is in charge of target provisioning.

board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


### **How to use it ?**


Before compiling the project, you should first start the provisioning process.
During the provisioning process, the linker files of project as well as the postbuild commands will be automatically updated.


All scripts are relying on env.bat for tools path and application path. (ROT\_Provisioning/env.bat)


The **provisioning process** (OEMuROT/provisioning.bat) is divided into 3 majors steps :


* Step 1 : Configuration management


	+ DA password configuration : Set the password of debug opening
	+ OEMuROT keys configuration : Generate new OEMuROT keys if necessary
	+ BootROM keys configuration : Generate new BootROM if necessary
* Step 2 : Image generation


	+ Boot firmware image generation : Build the OEMuROT\_Boot project with the preferred toolchain.
	+ Secure Code firmware image generation : Build the OEMuROT\_Appli\_Secure project with the preferred toolchain.
	+ Non Secure Code firmware image generation : Build the OEMuROT\_Appli\_NonSecure project with the preferred toolchain.
	+ Secure Data generation : Secure Data image generation with TrustedPackageCreator, if secure data image enabled.
	+ Non Secure Data generation : Non Secure Data image generation with TrustedPackageCreator, if non secure data image enabled.
* Step 3 : Provisioning


	+ Flash the images using flash\_programming.bat.


The provisioning script is relying on flash\_programming script.


It is possible to run flash\_programming.bat directly (advanced mode).


The **flash\_programming process** (OEMuROT/flash\_programming.bat) includes :


* Erase OEMuROT slots
* Program Images


	+ Download boot image.
	+ Download secure application image.
	+ Download non secure application image.
	+ Download secure data image if enabled.
	+ Download non secure data image if enabled.


Environment Setup
-----------------


All scripts rely on env.bat for setting the necessary tools path and application path.


* File path : ROT\_Provisioning/env.bat.
* Purpose : Sets the necessary tools path and application path for Windows, Linux and Mac operating system.
* Usage : Exporting the Environment Variables, Path Configuration, Dependency Setup, Perform initial setup tasks.

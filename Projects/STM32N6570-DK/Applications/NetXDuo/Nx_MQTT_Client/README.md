## <b>Nx_MQTT_Client Application Description</b>

This application provides an example of Azure RTOS NetX/NetXDuo stack usage.
It shows how to exchange data between client and server using MQTT protocol in an encrypted mode supporting TLS v1.3.

The main entry function tx_application_define() is called by ThreadX during kernel start, at this stage, all NetX resources are created.

+ A <i>NX_PACKET_POOL</i>is allocated

+ A <i>NX_IP</i> instance using that pool is initialized

+ The <i>ARP</i>, <i>ICMP</i>, <i>UDP</i> and <i>TCP</i> protocols are enabled for the <i>NX_IP</i> instance

+ A <i>DHCP client is created.</i>

The application then creates 3 threads with the different priorities:

**NxAppThread** (priority 10, PreemtionThreashold 10) : created with the <i>TX_AUTO_START</i> flag to start automatically.

**AppMQTTClientThread** (priority 3, PreemtionThreashold 3) : created with the <i>TX_DONT_START</i> flag to be started later.

**AppSNTPThread** (priority 5, PreemtionThreashold 5) : created with the <i>TX_DONT_START</i> flag to be started later.


The **NxAppThread** starts and perform the following actions:

  + creates a dns_client with USER_DNS_ADDRESS (default value defined IP_ADDRESS(1, 1, 1, 1) on app_netxduo.h.

  + starts the DHCP client

  + waits for the IP address resolution

  + resumes the **AppSNTPThread**

The **AppSNTPThread**, once started:

  + it connects to an SNTP server to get the current time.

  + resumes the **AppMQTTClientThread**

The **AppMQTTClientThread**, once started:

  + creates an mqtt_client

  + connects mqtt_client to the online MQTT broker; connection with server will be secure and a **tls_setup_callback** will set TLS parameters.
  By default MQTT_PORT for encrypted mode is 8883.

          refer to note 4 below, to know how to setup an x509 certificate.

  + mqtt_client subscribes on a predefined topic TOPIC_NAME  "Temperature" with a Quality Of Service QOS0

  + depending on the number of message "NB_MESSAGE" defined by user, mqtt_client will publish a random number generated by RNG. If NB_MESSAGE = 0, it means that number of messages is infinitely.

  + mqtt_client will get messages from the MQTT broker and print them.

#### <b>Expected success behavior</b>

 + The board IP address is printed on the HyperTerminal
 + Connection's information are printed on the HyperTerminal (broker's name, mqtt port, topic and messages received)

 ```
MQTT client connected to broker < test.mosquitto.org > at PORT 8883 :
Message 1 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 34
Message 2 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 35
Message 3 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 35
Message 4 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 34
Message 5 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 33
Message 6 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 34
Message 7 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 35
Message 8 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 35
Message 9 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 34
Message 10 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 33
client disconnected from broker < test.mosquitto.org >.
 ```
 + Green LED is toggling after successfully receiving all messages.

#### <b>Error behaviors</b>

+ The red LED is toggling to indicate any error that has occurred.

#### <b> Assumptions if any</b>

- The Application is using the DHCP to acquire IP address, thus a DHCP server should be reachable by the board in the LAN used to test the application.
- The application is configuring the Ethernet IP with a static predefined MAC Address, make sure to change it in case multiple boards are connected on
the same LAN to avoid any potential network traffic issues.

- The MAC Address is defined in the `main.c`

```
void MX_ETH_Init(void)
{

  /* USER CODE BEGIN ETH_Init 0 */

  /* USER CODE END ETH_Init 0 */

  /* USER CODE BEGIN ETH_Init 1 */

  /* USER CODE END ETH_Init 1 */
  heth.Instance = ETH1;
  MACAddr[0] = 0x00;
  MACAddr[1] = 0x80;
  MACAddr[2] = 0xE0;
  MACAddr[3] = 0x00;
  MACAddr[4] = 0x10;
  MACAddr[5] = 0x00;
```
#### <b>Known limitations</b>

* Default NX_DNS_MAX_RETRIES value in "nx_user.h" may not work with some MQTT servers, they should be tuned for example:

    #define NX_DNS_MAX_RETRIES  10

* Since NetXDuo does not support proxy, mqtt_client should be connected directly to the server.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. To make an encrypted connection with MQTT server, user should follow these steps to add an x509 certificate to the _mqtt\_client_ and use it to ensure server's authentication :
      - download certificate authority CA (in this application "mosquitto.org.der" downloaded from [test.mosquitto](https://test.mosquitto.org)
      - convert certificate downloaded by executing the following cmd from the file downloaded path :

                                xxd.exe -i mosquitto.org.der > mosquitto.cert.h

      - add the converted file under the application : NetXDuo/Nx_MQTT_Client/NetXDuo/App
      - configure MOSQUITTO_CERT_FILE with your certificate name.

#### <b>ThreadX usage hints</b>

 - ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.
 - ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always possible to reconfigure it, by updating the "TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND" define in the "tx_user.h" file. The update should be reflected in "tx_initialize_low_level.S" file too.
 - ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions.
 - ThreadX offers the "tx_application_define()" function, that is automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API.
   It is highly recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools...)  but it should not in any way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).
 - Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to the linker file.
   ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function,
   using the "first_unused_memory" argument.
   This requires changes in the linker files to expose this memory location.
    + For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file:
     ```
	 place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };
	 ```

    + The "tx_initialize_low_level.S" should be also modified to enable the "USE_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION" flag.

#### <b>NetX Duo usage hints</b>

- Depending on the application scenario, the total TX and RX descriptors may need to be increased by updating respectively  the "ETH_TX_DESC_CNT" and "ETH_RX_DESC_CNT" in the "stm32n6xx_hal_conf.h", to guarantee the application correct behaviour, but this will cost extra memory to allocate.

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Edit the file app_netxduo.h : define the USER_DNS_ADDRESS (if necessary), the MQTT_BROKER_NAME and NB_MESSAGE.
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory. Code can be executed in this mode for debugging purposes.

Next, this program can be run in boot from flash mode. This can be done by following the instructions below:

 - Resort to CubeProgrammer to add a header to the generated binary Project.bin with the following command
   - *STM32_SigningTool_CLI.exe -bin Nx_MQTT_Client.bin -nk -of 0x80000000 -t fsbl -o Nx_MQTT_Client-trusted.bin -hv 2.3 -dump Nx_MQTT_Client-trusted.bin*
       - The resulting binary is Nx_MQTT_Client-trusted.bin.
 - Next, in resorting again to CubeProgrammer, load the binary and its header (Nx_MQTT_Client-trusted.bin) in Nucleo board external Flash at address 0x7000'0000.
 - Set the boot mode in boot from external Flash (BOOT0 switch position is 1-2 and BOOT1 switch position is 1-2).
 - Press the reset button. The code then executes in boot from external Flash mode.
